<h3>Git <img

</h3>
<p>Git is a version control system that helps track code changes and collaborate
    with others. It organizes projects in repositories, allows creating branches
    for separate developments, and uses commits to save snapshots of changes.
    Key actions include staging changes (git add), committing them (git commit),
    and syncing with remote repositories using push and pull commands. You can
    create and merge branches for managing features or bug fixes, and best
    practices include writing clear commit messages, resolving conflicts
    promptly, and keeping branches updated.</p>

<h3>Docker</h3>
<p>Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in
    lightweight, portable containers. Containers package an application and its
    dependencies, ensuring consistency across environments. Key components
    include Docker Images (blueprints for containers) and Docker Containers
    (runtime instances of images). Common commands include building images
    (docker build), running containers (docker run), viewing active containers
    (docker ps), and stopping containers (docker stop). Docker simplifies
    deployment, improves scalability, and is widely used for creating
    reproducible development and production environments.</p>

<h3>Postman</h3>
<p>Postman is a collaboration platform for API development and testing. It
    allows users to send requests, inspect responses, and automate testing
    workflows. Core features include creating collections for organizing
    requests, using environments for managing variables, and automating tests
    with JavaScript. Postman is essential for debugging and ensuring API
    reliability.</p>
