            <p><samp>Podman</samp> is an open-source container engine that
                provides a Docker-compatible experience but operates without
                requiring a centralized daemon. Unlike Docker, Podman is
                daemonless, which means containers are managed directly under
                the user's control, enhancing security and flexibility. Podman
                supports rootless operation, allowing containers to run without
                elevated privileges. It's often used as a drop-in replacement
                for Docker in environments where security and system integration
                are priorities.</p>

            <p><samp>Docker</samp>is an open-source platform designed to
                automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight,
                portable containers. Containers package an application and its
                dependencies together, ensuring consistency across environments
                (e.g., development, testing, production). Docker simplifies app
                deployment, scales easily, and reduces conflicts caused by
                differences in operating systems or configurations. It consists
                of tools like the Docker Engine for running containers and
                Docker Hub for sharing them. Developers use it to streamline
                workflows and improve portability. </p>
